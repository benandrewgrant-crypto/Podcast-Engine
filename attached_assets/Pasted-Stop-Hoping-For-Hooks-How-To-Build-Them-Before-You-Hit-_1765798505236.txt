Stop Hoping For Hooks: How To Build Them Before You Hit Record

Most creators treat hooks like lottery wins. They record for hours, then pray they’ll “find something” in the edit that works for YouTube or short form. That is why so many videos open with 15 seconds of slow death.



The reality is this.. hooks are not found, they are built. And the best ones are locked in during pre production.

Here is how you actually do it.

1. Start with the title and thumbnail in mind

On YouTube, your hook starts before the video even plays. If you know the promise you’re making in the title and thumbnail, you can design your opening moments to deliver on it immediately. No generic intros, no “thanks for joining us” fluff. The viewer should feel they’re already mid-conversation when the video starts.

2. Script your first 15 seconds like it’s a trailer

The first line should create tension, surprise, or an unanswered question. You can even script two or three options before recording and see which one lands better in the room. Do not trust yourself to improvise brilliance when the cameras are rolling.

3. Plant hook moments throughout the conversation

A great hook does not have to live at the very start. Drop intentional “mini hooks” every few minutes. These are moments of high intrigue, strong emotion, or bold claims you can repurpose for clips and shorts. Think of them as checkpoints for retention.

4. Direct your guest towards them

If you are interviewing, guide the conversation toward topics you know will yield hookable lines. That might mean framing a question to provoke a surprising opinion or asking them to recall a turning point story with detail and emotion.

5. Leave something unsaid

In both long and short form, curiosity is a weapon. A hook works when it gives just enough information to make the viewer need the rest. Your job in pre production is to decide what to reveal and what to hold back until they’ve committed to watching longer.

6. Rehearse it

Yes, rehearse. Say the line out loud. Test the pacing, tone, and emphasis. Record it into your phone and listen back. The best hooks sound natural, not read.

When you walk into a recording with hooks already in your pocket, the edit stops being a rescue mission. You are not rummaging through hours of footage for something that might work. You are executing a plan that was built to win before the camera even turned on.
